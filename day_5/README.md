# Day 5: 30 Days of Python Programming

## Level 1

* Declare an empty list.
* Declare a list with more than 5 items.
* Find the length of your list.
* Get the first item, the middle item, and the last item of the list.
* Declare a list called `mixed_data_types` and include your name, age, height, marital status, and address.
* Declare a list variable named `it_companies` and assign initial values: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Oracle, Amazon.
* Print the list using `print()`.
* Print the number of companies in the list.
* Print the first, middle, and last company.
* Print the list after modifying one of the companies.
* Add an IT company to `it_companies`.
* Insert an IT company in the middle of the companies list.
* Change one of the `it_companies` names to uppercase (IBM excluded!).
* Join the `it_companies` with a string `'#;  '`.
* Check if a certain company exists in the `it_companies` list.
* Sort the list using the `sort()` method.
* Reverse the list in descending order using the `reverse()` method.
* Slice out the first 3 companies from the list.
* Slice out the last 3 companies from the list.
* Slice out the middle IT company or companies from the list.
* Remove the first IT company from the list.
* Remove the middle IT company or companies from the list.
* Remove the last IT company from the list.
* Remove all IT companies from the list.
* Destroy the IT companies list.
* Join the following lists:
  ```
   front_end = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Redux']
   back_end = ['Node','Express', 'MongoDB']
  ```
* After joining the lists in question above, copy the joined list and assign it to a variable `full_stack`, then insert `Python` and `SQL` after `Redux`.

## Level 2

* The following is a list of 10 students’ ages:
  ```
  ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
   ```
* Sort the list and find the min and max age.
* Add the min age and the max age again to the list.
* Find the median age (one middle item or average of two middle items if even).
* Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number).
* Find the range of the ages (max minus min).
* Compare the value of `(min - average)` and `(max - average)` using the `abs()` method.
* Find the middle country(ies) in the countries list:
  ```
    countries = ["USA", "Nepal", "UAE", "Somaliland", "Malaysia", "South Sudan", "Bangladesh"]
  ```
* Divide the countries list into two equal lists; if the list length is odd, the first half gets one extra country.
