# 💻 Day 16 – `datetime` Module (Python)


1. Get the current day, month, year, hour, minute, and timestamp using the `datetime` module.
2. Format the current date using the following format:  
   `"%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"`
3. The string **"Today is 28 January, 2026"** — change this time string to a time object.
4. Calculate the time difference between now and New Year.
5. Calculate the time difference between **1 January 1970** and now.
6. Think about what you can use the `datetime` module for. Examples:
   - Time series analysis
   - Getting timestamps for activities in an application
   - Adding posts on a blog
