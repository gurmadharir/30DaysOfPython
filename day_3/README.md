# Day 3: 30 Days of Python Programming

## Exercise: Level 1 – Variables
- Create a folder called `day_3` inside `30DaysOfPython`.
- Inside the folder, create a file named `operators.py`.
- Write Python comments at the top describing each task.
- Declare the following variables:
  - `age` → integer
  - `height` → float
  - `complex_number` → complex number

---

## Exercise: Level 2 – Geometry Calculations
- **Triangle Area**
  - Prompt the user to enter `base` and `height` of a triangle.
  - Calculate the area using:
    ```python
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    ```
  - Print the result.

- **Triangle Perimeter**
  - Prompt the user to enter `side a`, `side b`, and `side c`.
  - Calculate perimeter:
    ```python
    perimeter = a + b + c
    ```
  - Print the result.

- **Rectangle Area and Perimeter**
  - Prompt the user to enter `length` and `width`.
  - Calculate:
    ```python
    area = length * width
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    ```
  - Print both values.

- **Circle Area and Circumference**
  - Prompt the user to enter `radius`.
  - Use `pi = 3.14`.
  - Calculate:
    ```python
    area = pi * radius ** 2
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius
    ```
  - Print both values.

## Exercise: Level 3 – Slope and Distance
- **Line Equation**
  - For `y = 2x - 2`, calculate:
    - Slope
    - X-intercept
    - Y-intercept
  - Print results.

- **Slope and Distance Between Points**
  - Given points `(2,2)` and `(6,10)`:
    - Calculate slope:
      ```python
      slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
      ```
    - Calculate Euclidean distance:
      ```python
      distance = ((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)**0.5
      ```
  - Compare the slope with the slope of the line `y = 2x - 2`.

---

## Exercise: Level 4 – Quadratic and Strings
- **Quadratic Equation**
  - Evaluate `y = x^2 + 6x + 9` for multiple x values.
  - Determine when `y = 0`.

- **Strings**
  - Find the length of `"Python"` and `"Dragon"` and compare (falsy comparison).
  - Check if `"on"` exists in both `"Python"` and `"Dragon"` using the `and` operator.
  - Check if `"jargon"` exists in the sentence `"I hope this course is not full of jargon"`.
  - Convert the length of `"Python"` to `float` and then to `string`.

---

## Exercise: Level 5 – Numbers and Comparisons
- Check if a number is **even** using `% 2`.
- Check if **floor division** `7 // 3` is equal to `int(2.7)`.
- Check if the **type** of `'10'` is equal to the type of `10`.
- Check if `int('9.8')` is equal to 10.

---

## Exercise: Level 6 – User Input Calculations
- **Weekly Pay**
  - Prompt user for `hours` and `rate per hour`.
  - Calculate:
    ```python
    pay = hours * rate
    ```
  - Print weekly earnings.

- **Seconds Lived**
  - Prompt user for the number of **years lived**.
  - Assume a person can live **100 years**.
  - Calculate total seconds:
    ```python
    seconds_in_a_year = 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
    total_seconds = years_lived * seconds_in_a_year
    ```
  - Print the result.

---

## Exercise: Level 7 – Display Table
- Display the following table:
````
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 4 8
3 1 3 9 27
4 1 4 16 64
5 1 5 25 125
````

## Notes
These exercises reinforce core Python fundamentals such as variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and user input handling.
