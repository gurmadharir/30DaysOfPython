# 💻 Day 6: Python Tuples


## 📘 Level 1

1. Create an empty tuple
2. Create a tuple containing the names of your sisters and brothers (imaginary siblings are allowed)
3. Join the brothers and sisters tuples and assign the result to `siblings`
4. Find out how many siblings you have
5. Add the names of your father and mother to the siblings tuple and assign it to `family_members`

---

## 📗 Level 2

1. Unpack parents and siblings from the `family_members` tuple
2. Create tuples for:

   * Fruits
   * Vegetables
   * Animal products
3. Join the three tuples and assign the result to `food_stuff_tp`
4. Convert the `food_stuff_tp` tuple into a list called `food_stuff_lt`
5. Slice out the middle item or items from `food_stuff_tp` or `food_stuff_lt`
6. Slice out the first three and the last three items from `food_stuff_lt`
7. Delete the `food_stuff_tp` tuple completely
8. Check if specific items exist in a tuple:

   * Check if **'Estonia'** is a Nordic country
   * Check if **'Iceland'** is a Nordic country

Use the following tuple for the checks:

```python
nordic_countries = ('Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden')
```
