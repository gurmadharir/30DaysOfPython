# Day 2: 30 Days of Python Programming

## Exercise: Level 1
- Inside 30DaysOfPython, create a folder called day_2.
- Inside this folder, create a file named variables.py.
- Write a Python comment at the top:
- Declare the following variables and assign values to them:
    - first name
    - last name
    - full name
    - country
    - city
    - age
    - year
    - is married
    - is true
    - is light on
- Declare multiple variables on one line.

## Exercise: Level 2
- Check the data type of all your variables using the type() built-in function.
- Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name.
- Compare the length of your first name and your last name.
- Declare 5 as number one and 4 as number two.
- Perform the following operations and assign the results to variables:
    - Add number one and number two → total
    - Subtract number two from number one → diff
    - Multiply number one and number two → product
    - Divide number one by number two → division
    - Use modulus to find number two divided by number one → remainder
    - Find number one to the power of number two → exp
    - Find floor division of number one by number two → floor_division
- Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
- Use the built-in input() function to get:
    - first name
    - last name
    - country
    - age
  
  from the user and store them in corresponding variables.
- Run help('keywords') in the Python shell or in your file to check Python reserved words.
